# What is Integration Testing

[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing)

Integration testing is (typically) the next layer of testing above unit tests. Of concern is the interaction between two or more "units". Integration tests verify that the components of an application work (correctly) together. 

~~Integration tests can be "functional", where the application is actually run (e.g. a model training pipeline needs to produce a model output).~~
